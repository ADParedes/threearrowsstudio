                    <div class="story__text">
                        <p>The story of Three Arrows Studio begins with three little hearts and one big God. I'm <span data-config="founder-name">[Your Name]</span>, and I never imagined that my greatest heartbreak would become the foundation for something so beautiful.</p>
                        
                        <p>When I found myself walking the unexpected path of single motherhood with my three precious arrows‚ÄîJude, Wyatt, and Lucy‚ÄîI felt anything but equipped for the journey ahead. Those early days were filled with whispered prayers in the dark, tears mixed with determination, and a desperate clinging to the promises of God.</p>
                        
                        <p>It was during one of those late-night seasons, when sleep was scarce and hope felt scarcer, that I stumbled upon Psalm 127:4: "Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are children born in one's youth." In that moment, the Lord whispered to my heart that my children weren't burdens to bear‚Äîthey were weapons of warfare, tools of victory, arrows in the hands of the ultimate Warrior.</p>
                        
                        <p>Three Arrows Studio was born from those sacred middle-of-the-night revelations, when creativity became my prayer and art became my worship. What started as therapeutic late-night design sessions slowly transformed into something bigger‚Äîa calling to encourage other mothers walking similar paths of faith, hope, and beautiful surrender.</p>
                        
                        <p>Every piece I create is infused with prayer, born from real-life struggles, and designed to remind you that your home doesn't need to be perfect to be sacred. It just needs to reflect the love that lives within its walls. Whether you're in a season of abundance or walking through the valley, my prayer is that these designs speak hope over your space and joy into your heart.</p>
                        
                        <p>Because at the end of the day, we're all just walking each other home‚Äîand the journey is so much sweeter when we walk it together.</p>

                        <p class="behind-scenes__text">Our little studio space is tucked into the corner of our home, where creative chaos meets holy inspiration. It's here, surrounded by coffee cups and colored pencils, scripture cards and sketches, that each design comes to life.</p>
                        
                        <p class="behind-scenes__text">My creative process always begins with prayer. I ask the Lord what message He wants to speak through art, what heart needs encouragement, what home needs a reminder of His faithfulness. Then I dive into His Word, letting scripture guide both the message and the design.</p>
                        
                        <p class="behind-scenes__text">Most of my work happens in the quiet hours‚Äîearly mornings before little feet hit the floor, late evenings after bedtime stories are read and prayers are prayed. There's something sacred about creating in those peaceful moments, when it's just me, God, and the beautiful work He's called me to.</p>
